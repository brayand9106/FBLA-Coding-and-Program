# FBLA-Coding-and-Program

This was our project for the 2024 April FBLA competition for states in Arizona!

We utilized a plan using the iterative process in our program!
We used a primarily backend program that uses python as our language, PySimpleGUI as our framework, and the Pandas library to manage data.
The data is exported on to the user's folder in their C drive through a spreadsheet as the database from the inputs made.
